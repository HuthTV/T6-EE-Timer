## ‚öôÔ∏è T6EE settings
The timer has several settings that persist between restarts and game sessions. These settings can be changed by typing commands directly into the ingame chat or by editing the file: `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\raw\scriptdata\T6EE.cfg`

The following chat commands are available.  
| Command   | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| timer   | Toggles the ingame timer (requires a map restart)   |
| strafe  | Switches strafe DVARs between console and PC values |
| speed   | Toggles the speedometer                             |
| restore | Resets your config file to default settings         |


## Chat Restarts
Players can initiate a fast restart by typing `r`, `restart`, or `fast_restart` in the game chat. To simplify restarts, players can bind a key to the say command. For example, `bind F2 say restart` in the game console.

## Persistent Upgrades, Bank, & Fridge 
Upon spawning, players will be awarded all persistent upgrades except Insta-Kill. The player's bank will also be set to the maximum amount. On Die Rise, an upgraded SVU will be placed in the player's fridge. To change which upgrades are active, use the following boolean console DVARs to enable or disable specific upgrades or bank fill.

```
full_bank
pers_jugg
pers_boarding
pers_carpenter
pers_insta_kill
pers_nube_counter
pers_revivenoperk
